# Topic 1: DevOps – Concepts & Lifecycle

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture and process that combines **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)**  
to enable faster, reliable, and continuous delivery of applications.

In small organizations, the same team may handle both Dev and Ops.  
In large organizations, Dev and Ops are separate teams but collaborate closely.
